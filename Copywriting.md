# Sawyer Hollenshead

I’m a product designer and developer interested in prototyping, designing, and building practical, purpose-driven products that empower others. I’m currently a partner at Oak Studios. I also enjoy the occasional fun side-project, so give me a shout if you think we’d be a good fit.

Below are selected works from 2007-present.

## Siteleaf

[create a page > add meta data > upload file > publish]

Initially designed and built in one month with Oak Studios, Siteleaf has grown to become a formidable CMS for static websites. Our philosophy behind Siteleaf is that you should be able to host your website anywhere you want. That websites should be able to outlive their CMS. That our tools should be simplified, not dumbed down. In version 2 we added 100% compatibility with Jekyll, the same static site platform that powers over half a million sites on GitHub Pages.

As part of the 4 person team, I lead the design and front-end development of the CMS focusing on building powerful, pro-level controls for advanced users already familiar with Jekyll, but also as simple and clear as possible for clients who may be less advanced and just want to update their damn site.

One feature of Jekyll is the ability to have “front matter” attached to your pages, which is an easy way to set predefined variables for use in the page’s template. The front matter is stored as YAML, so can support various value types: strings, booleans, arrays, objects, etc. In Siteleaf we called this type of content “Metadata” and we wanted to make the user experience for adding metadata as simple as possible. A normal user shouldn’t need to know what YAML is or how to properly format values. We decided to simplify the meta field options to “Simple” (a text field), “List” (an array), or an “Object”. Using these three ingredients a user can create a system that works for pretty much any use case they throw at it.

In Siteleaf, site content is grouped by “collections”. The two most basic collections are “Pages” and “Posts”, but you can add additional collections that fit your site’s content, like “People”, “Videos”, and so on.

To make it easier for users to reference content in collections, we built a system where a metadata field’s controls would adapt based on the field’s “key”. If you have a collection called “People” and you created a meta field with a key called “Person”, it would turn into a dropdown menu with options autofilled based on the existing content in the “People” collection. 

Taking this idea a step further, you could also create a field called “file” or “header image” and an upload button would appear in the field.

## CreativeMornings

[browse talks page > watch talk > go to cities page]

CreativeMornings is a breakfast lecture series for the creative community, founded by Tina Roth Eisenberg. In 2012, after a successful Kickstarter campaign, they approached Oak Studios to help design and build their online presence. As part of the team, I lead the design and front-end development of the initial CreativeMornings.com which included over 350 hours of video, 11 languages, and an administrative section for hosts to manage event registration and content. Over time, through our ongoing relationship with CreativeMornings, I’ve moved onto leading the front-end and Rails development, supporting a site that has grown to over 100k users, over 2k videos, and a presence in over 130 creative cities.

The center piece of CreativeMornings are the morning breakfast lectures which happen in every city on a Friday of every month. Each talk is recorded and uploaded to the site afterwards.

CreativeMornings is a joyful, creative community, so throughout the site we wanted to be sure to inject moments of delight for the user. We introduced fun things like a “hinged” dropdown menu that falls off the site when you log in and raining hearts when you liked a video.

## Dropmark

[add image to collection > open image > add annotation]

Dropmark is the smart way to organize all your links, files, and notes into visual collections. As part of the 3 person team at Oak Studios, I helped shape the product vision, design, and development. In 2015 I focused on making the product self-sustaining, leading the creation of the “Teams” functionality, additional “Pro” features like image annotations and an overall improved user experience. This effort resulted in a 171% increase in monthly recurring revenue and an 1100% increase in upgrades compared to the year before.

## My highlights workflow

[browse higlights > click book > click higlight]

I used to use a reading platform called Readmill to store all of my ebooks and highlights, however they were eventually acquired by Dropbox and shut down in 2014. After their shutdown my highlights became trapped in the apps I read in, usually iBooks or Kindle. As a result I took it upon myself to build a workflow that allowed me to export my highlights and store them on my own site. 

## Gazette

Gazette was a product experiment I helped design at Oak Studios. It allowed you to subscribe to your favorite blogs, websites, and publications and receive a weekly, personalized ebook to read and highlight on iOS, Kindle, or other device that supported ePub/Mobi formats. It synced issues with Readmill, Kindle, and also allowed you to download directly.
