Dropmark is the smart way to organize all your links, files, and notes into visual collections. As part of the 3 person team at Oak Studios, I helped shape the product vision, design, and development. In 2015 I focused on making the product self-sustaining, leading the creation of the “Teams” functionality, additional “Pro” features like image annotations and an overall improved user experience. This effort resulted in a 171% increase in monthly recurring revenue and an 1100% increase in upgrades compared to the year before.
