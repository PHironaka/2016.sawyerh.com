I used to use a reading platform called Readmill to store all of my ebooks and highlights, however they were eventually acquired by Dropbox and shut down in 2014. After their shutdown my highlights became trapped in the apps I read in, usually iBooks or Kindle. As a result I took it upon myself to build a workflow that allowed me to export my highlights and store them on my own site.
