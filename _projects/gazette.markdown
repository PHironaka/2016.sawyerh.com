Gazette was a product experiment I helped design at Oak Studios. It allowed you to subscribe to your favorite blogs, websites, and publications and receive a weekly, personalized ebook to read and highlight on iOS, Kindle, or other device that supported ePub/Mobi formats. It synced issues with Readmill, Kindle, and also allowed you to download directly.
