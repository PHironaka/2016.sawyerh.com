A constantly updated list of ideas for products/projects I find interesting, but will probably never do due to lack of time, interest, ability, or they're just totally unrealistic. So have it:

**Google Glass facial recognition app** that overlays an emoji over people's faces based on their expression. (Update: After actually wearing a Google Glass, I now realize the screen isn't your entire field of vision. Maybe someday.)

**A physical book consisting of a mix of normal paper pages and flexible digital screen pages.** The cover could be a solar panel that displays the cover design when fully charged.

**Hip-hop news aggregator**

**Internet router that identifies inactivity** and switches to "public" WiFi mode so others can use/share/rent it from you.

**API for giving donations to charities**

<del>App for setting an "emergency message" that gets sent to a contact if you don't disable it by a certain time.</del> Check out [kitestring.io](https://www.kitestring.io/)

**App that takes a photo then records 10 seconds** of video immediately after.

**Fluorescent religious symbols and classical sculpture for criminal activity.**

**Email client with an API** that developers can hook into. As easy to customize as Sublime Text is. Write your own hooks/filters.

**Twitter client** that rotates through the last 20 or so tweets, fading in one at a time. (Scrolling through a long list of tweets gives me serious anxiety.)

**Airline price watcher for specific locations.** Notifies you when a trip becomes affordable. "Notify me when a trip to San Francisco is less than $500."

**Physical room that can be controlled via the web.** One person in at a time. Everyone else spectates from a window.
