These are things I use on a daily basis. *Last updated on November 1, 2013*

## CSS and JS

[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) - Brings variables, mixins, and functions to your CSS. You won't write plain CSS again after using SASS

[SASS Mixins](https://github.com/sawyerh/cssmixins) -
A collection of SASS mixins that I use on every site I build. Takes away the pain of browser prefixes and responsive design.

[CSS Triangle Generator](http://apps.eky.hk/css-triangle-generator/)

[Animate CSS](http://daneden.me/animate/) - A collection of cross-browser CSS animations

[FitVids.js](https://github.com/davatron5000/FitVids.js) - Responsive videos

[jQuery Autosize](http://www.jacklmoore.com/autosize/) -
A plugin to automatically adjust textarea height.

[Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/) - jQuery plugin I use for things like tag input fields where a tag is turned into a deletable object.

[Emmet](https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime) - AKA "Zen Coding". Sublime Text plugin. I use it mostly for the [CSS Abbreviations](http://docs.emmet.io/css-abbreviations/).

[Sublime Linter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter) - Another handy Sublime Text plugin that lints all the codes.

[ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com/) - Optimizes the hell out of images.

[SVGO GUI](https://github.com/svg/svgo-gui) - Optimizes the hell out of SVG assets.

[Anvil](http://anvilformac.com) - Easily setup .dev URLs for local development

[TVShows 2](http://tvshowsapp.com/) - Automatically downloads the latest episodes of shows I subscribe to.
