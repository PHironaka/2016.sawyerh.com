Influenced by [@DestroyToday](http://twitter.com/destroytoday) previously [doing this](https://github.com/destroytoday/destroytoday.com/wiki) and the quote above, I'll be designing, prototyping, and building my personal site in the open. All iterations will be committed here and [tweeted out](http://twitter.com/sawyerh) as I progress. I fully expect this to be way more stressful than I initially guessed, so if you're digging it, [holler at me](http://twitter.com/sawyerh).
